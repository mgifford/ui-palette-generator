Accessibility checks with Sa11y

You can run a quick site-wide accessibility check using Sa11y. Start the local server first, then run:

```bash
# start local server (from project root)
npm start

# in a separate shell, run the a11y check
npm run a11y

# results will be written to reports/sa11y.json
```

Notes:
- Sa11y is run via `npx sa11y` by the `npm run a11y` script (added to `package.json`).
- Make sure the local server is reachable at `http://localhost:5000` when running the check.
- The `reports/` folder will be created if it does not exist.
