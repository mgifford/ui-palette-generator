This folder contains test helpers for automated accessibility scans.

- `scan-light.html` and `scan-dark.html` load the site and set a preferred theme so scanners can test both light and dark palettes.
- Reports generated by scanners should be saved to this folder during local runs, but they should not be committed to Git.

How to run (local):

```
npm run scan:light
npm run scan:dark
```

This will start the local server and write `docs/reports/axe-light.json` and `docs/reports/axe-dark.json` by default. Copy the reports into this folder for local archiving if desired.

Ignored content
--------------

The automated scans exclude decorative demo canvases that intentionally use palette tokens and therefore may not meet contrast thresholds. The scanner configuration excludes elements matching:

- `.demo-canvas[data-uses-token="canvas"]`
